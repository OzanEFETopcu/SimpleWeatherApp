# SimpleWeatherApp

## Purpose
This is a demonstration of a simple React Native application that can interact with a public API 
and keep its UI dynamic with every single update. 

## UI details
- As you will see below the UI is quite primitive and doesn't provide a lot of functionality, yet it displays
the values that are being parsed from the response of the API.

## How to run and setup
### Services you will need:
- This project is working with the free service of [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/guide) to use it the API key needs to be replaced with a personal one.
- Then running the file with <code>npx expo start</code> should be done.
